whenever a webpage is launched through a browser and an xpath is written in chrome or firefox
Every browser has an engine called the "Xpath Engine" and this is specific for all the browsers
Chrome, Firefox or Edge browser each of them have their own Xpath Engine
When we are writing By.xpath() for example in Chrome, Chrome is interacting with the xpath engine
and the xpath engine is finding the element from the xpath given in the DOM.Once the element is
available either the WebElement is returned or an action like click() is performed or
the text from the WE is returned.The same behaviour is seen on FF, Edge or other browsers.
The speed of the xpath depends on the xpath engine(this is specific for every browser).
Xpath engine fetches the element from the DOM depending on the xpath defined in the By locator.
Many yrs back when IE used to be used its xpath engine was very slow, suppose if it takes 1 hr
on Chrome to execute 50 tests then the same tests would take 2 hrs on IE. Now the Chrome and 
the Edge browser has a very special Chromium Engine which is used by Chrome n Edge.Thus both have 
similar performances wrt to the xpaths. If very old versions of chrome or ie or ff are used then
in that case the performance will be slow due to the xpath engines.These days nobody uses those
browsers.If a test uses 100 xpaths and the CSS Selectors are written for the same elements 
then in that case it is seen that the xpaths have a better performance.relative xpaths have a
better performance when compared to absolute xpaths
	In realtime xpaths and css selectors give good performance but their usage depends on the
usecase

 To get the calories column:
 1.		//div[text()='Calories']/ancestor::thead//following-sibling::tr/td[2]
 2.		//div[contains(text(),'Fat (g)')]/ancestor::thead//following-sibling::tr/td[3]

 To get a row wrt to a dessert
 //td[text()='Frozen yogurt']/following-sibling::td
 
 To get a column from a table will be by an index(in this case Calories is being displayed)
 //table[@class='mat-sort table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow is-hoverable is-fullwidth']//td[2]
