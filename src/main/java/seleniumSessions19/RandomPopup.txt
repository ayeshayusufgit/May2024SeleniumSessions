3.Do some activity on the webapp
4.again a random popup is seen after 10 mins,cancel that popup
 5.These popups come in the Production Environment
 Can this be handled?
 
How do we know wen its coming?
There is no guarantee whether its coming again?
The behavior of the random popup cannot be predicted 
This scenario with random popup cannot be handled with any automation tool


Captcha can never be automated
Random popups cannot be automated as we cannot predict the behavior of the popups
No automation tools like Selenium, Cypress etc etc can automate Captcha
